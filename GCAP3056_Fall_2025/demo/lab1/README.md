# Lab 1: Curating Public Source Information

## Overview
This lab guides you through the process of systematically organizing information gathered from public sources and using AI to identify key issues and formulate questions for government inquiries. This is a crucial skill for policy research and advocacy work.

## Objectives
- Learn to systematically organize information from multiple public sources using a structured template
- Use AI to analyze and synthesize information from multiple sources
- Identify key issues and information gaps that need to be addressed
- Formulate specific, actionable questions for government staff based on gathered information
- Structure information effectively for policy research and advocacy

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Lab 0 (basic file processing with AI)
- Access to public sources of information (news articles, government reports, research papers, etc.)
- Basic understanding of markdown formatting
- Access to an AI coding assistant (like Cursor)

## Instructions
See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.

    └── questions_for_government.md # Generated: Questions for government staff
```

## Workflow

1. **Gather Sources** - Collect information from public sources (news, reports, websites, etc.)
2. **Create Input Files** - Use the template to create structured files for each source
3. **Organize Information** - Place all source files in the `input/` folder
4. **Use AI Analysis** - Ask AI to read all input files and generate analysis
5. **Review Output** - Check the generated files in the `output/` folder
6. **Refine** - Review and refine the AI-generated issues and questions

## Key Deliverables

1. **Input Files** (in `input/` folder)
   - Multiple source files created using the template
   - Each file contains information from one public source

2. **Output Files** (in `output/` folder, generated by AI)
   - `issues_to_address.md` - Key issues and information gaps
   - `questions_for_government.md` - Specific questions for government staff

## Resources
- Template file: `input/template_public_info.md`
- [Markdown formatting guide]
- [How to write effective government inquiry questions]
- [Public information sources and fact-checking]

## Notes
- Quality over quantity: It's better to have 3-5 well-documented sources than many incomplete ones
- Be specific: Vague information leads to vague questions
- Cross-reference: Look for patterns or contradictions across sources
- Keep track: Make sure you can trace back all identified issues and questions to specific sources
- Refine iteratively: The AI output is a starting point - review and improve it

## Next Steps
After completing this lab, you'll be ready to:
- Use the identified issues to guide your research
- Use the generated questions as a basis for formal government inquiries
- Continue gathering and organizing information as your project progresses
