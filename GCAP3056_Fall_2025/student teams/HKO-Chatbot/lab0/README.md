# Lab 0: AI-Powered File Processing

## Overview
This lab introduces you to working with AI agents to process and analyze files. You'll learn how to instruct AI to work with specific folders and generate outputs, which is essential for managing your project documentation.

## Objectives
- Learn how to specify input and output folders for AI agents
- Explore different file processing tasks (summarization, extraction, analysis)
- Practice designing clear instructions for AI-assisted workflows
- Understand how AI can help organize and process project documentation

## Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with markdown files
- Understanding of folder structures
- Access to an AI coding assistant (like Cursor)

## Instructions
See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions with multiple task options to explore.

## Folder Structure
```
lab0/
├── README.md          # This file
├── INSTRUCTIONS.md    # Detailed instructions with task options
├── input/             # Input files folder (empty - you'll specify what goes here)
└── output/            # Output files folder (empty - AI will place results here)
```

## Task Options
The INSTRUCTIONS.md file includes 5 different task options:
1. **Content Summarization** - Basic file reading and summarization
2. **Data Extraction** - Structured data extraction
3. **Analysis and Insights** - Pattern identification and analysis
4. **File Organization** - Content-based organization
5. **Custom Task** - Design your own!

## Exploration Challenge
Try at least 2-3 different task options to see how AI agents handle different types of requests. Document what works well and what doesn't!

## Submission
