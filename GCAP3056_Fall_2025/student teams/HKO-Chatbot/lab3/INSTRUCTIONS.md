# Lab 3: Git Operations with AI Agents

## Input

make changes to files in your project (or create new files). these changes will be committed and pushed to your forked repository.

## Process

use natural language instructions to ask AI agents to:

1. **Commit and push changes:**
   - Example prompt: "commit all changes made and push to the GitHub repo"

2. **Create pull request:**
   - Example prompt: "issue a pull request to https://github.com/tesolchina/3056AIFall2025 including my name ______ and student ID ______"

**How CLI works:** CLI (Command Line Interface) allows you to interact with your computer and tools like Git through text commands. AI agents can understand your natural language instructions and automatically generate the appropriate CLI commands (like `git commit`, `git push`, `gh pr create`) to execute the tasks you describe.

## Output

CLI commands that were generated and executed by the AI agent to commit and push changes to GitHub and issue pull requests 

What we learn here: use natural language to instruct AI agents to perform Git operations (commit, push to your fork) and create pull requests from your fork to the main repository. understand how AI translates your instructions into CLI commands automatically.
