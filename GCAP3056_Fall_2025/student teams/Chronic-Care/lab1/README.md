# Lab 1: Curating Public Source Information

## Overview
This lab guides you through systematically organizing information gathered from public sources and using AI to identify key issues and formulate questions for government inquiries.

## Objectives
- Organize information from multiple public sources using a structured template
- Use AI to analyze and synthesize information from multiple sources
- Identify key issues and information gaps
- Formulate specific questions for government staff based on gathered information

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Lab 0 (basic file processing with AI)
- Access to public sources of information (news articles, government reports, research papers, etc.)
- Basic understanding of markdown formatting
- Access to an AI coding assistant (like Cursor)

## Instructions
See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.

```

## Workflow

1. **Gather Sources** - Collect information from public sources
2. **Create Input Files** - Use the template to create structured files for each source
3. **Organize Information** - Place all source files in the `input/` folder
4. **Use AI Analysis** - Ask AI to read all input files and generate analysis
5. **Review Output** - Check the generated files in the `output/` folder
6. **Refine** - Review and refine the AI-generated issues and questions

## Key Deliverables

1. **Input Files** (in `input/` folder) - Multiple source files created using the template
2. **Output Files** (in `output/` folder, generated by AI) - Issues and questions for government

## Resources
- Template file: `input/template_public_info.md`
- Public information sources and fact-checking guides

## Notes
- Quality over quantity: It's better to have 3-5 well-documented sources
- Be specific: Vague information leads to vague questions
- Cross-reference: Look for patterns across sources
- Refine iteratively: Review and improve the AI output
